# Mind-Reader-Game
# Description
This is a fun and interactive Python program that appears to "read your mind" by guessing the number you kept in mind. The program walks you through a series of simple calculations and uses logic to determine the number based on your final answer.

# How It Works
You think of a number in your mind (but donâ€™t tell the program!).
The program guides you through a series of arithmetic steps:
Multiply your number by 5.
Add 5 to your result.
Multiply your new answer by 2.
Add 2 to your result.
You input your final answer after the calculations, and the program reveals the original number you thought of!
If the program cannot determine the number, it will prompt you to try the calculation again.

# Features
Simple, interactive text-based game.
Validates user input to ensure the calculations are correct.
Helps improve basic arithmetic skills in a fun way.

# Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher.
# How to Run
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the mind_reader.py file in any Python editor or IDE.
Run the program using Python 3:
  python mind_reader.py
Follow the prompts and enjoy the game!
